we do not need JUnit dependency so we have removed it
we need TestNG dependencies and selenium dependencies, so we will download them from - https://mvnrepository.com/

search TestNG and collect the latest dependency for my case today on 5th july it was - 
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.testng/testng -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.testng</groupId>
    <artifactId>testng</artifactId>
    <version>7.10.2</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

add this in pom.xml
