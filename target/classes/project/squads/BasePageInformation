BasePage will serve a first parent of all the pages 
we will define all generic data members and member functions in this BasePage

01) we have defined one BasePage and in this BasePage we have imported WebDriver from org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;

02) WebDriver is an interface provided by the Selenium library, 
which defines methods for interacting with web browsers (e.g., opening pages, clicking elements, entering text, etc.).

The driver variable is used to control a web browser instance. 
Through the driver, you can navigate to URLs, find elements on web pages, perform actions (like clicks and form submissions), 
and interact with the web application under test.

The 'driver' represents a specific instance of a 'web browser' being controlled by Selenium. 
For example, it could be an instance of ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver, etc., depending on which browser you are automating.

'WebDriver driver' is a variable that holds the instance of the 'web browser' being automated by Selenium.

The WebDriver interface provides a comprehensive set of methods for browser automation, 
enabling actions like navigating to URLs, interacting with web elements, managing cookies and windows, handling alerts, and more. 
These methods are essential for writing robust and maintainable Selenium tests.
